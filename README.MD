An AI-powered web application that automatically answers Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) using your own documents as a knowledge base. Just upload your course notes, take a screenshot of a quiz, and get the answer instantly.

The application runs entirely on your local machine, ensuring your data remains private.


## ✨ Core Features

-   **🧠 Intelligent Answering**: Utilizes a RAG pipeline to find the most relevant information in your documents and generate accurate answers.
-   **📸 Screenshot & Vision API**: Simply take a screenshot of a quiz. The app uses **Google Gemini Vision** to extract the question and options automatically.
-   **✂️ Built-in Screen Capture**: No need for external tools. Capture any part of your screen directly from the web interface.
-   **📚 PDF Knowledge Base**: Easily build a custom knowledge base by dragging and dropping your PDF course materials.
-   **🏠 Local & Private**: Your documents and queries never leave your machine, except for secure calls to the Google Gemini API. No user accounts needed.
-   **🚀 Modern Web Interface**: A clean, simple, and responsive UI built with FastAPI for a smooth user experience.
-   **🔌 RESTful API**: Includes clear endpoints to integrate the solving logic into other applications.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Backend**: FastAPI, Uvicorn
-   **AI & Machine Learning**: LangChain, Google Gemini (Vision & Pro), ChromaDB (Vector Store)
-   **Data Processing**: PyMuPDF, Pillow, Tiktoken
-   **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript

    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repo-url.git
    cd QCM-Resolver
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    # Create the virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate on Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # Activer on macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 3. Configuration

1.  Create a `.env` file in the project root.
2.  Add your Google Gemini API key to it:
    ```
    # .env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_SECRET_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```
    > **Note**: The `.env.example` file is provided as a template.

### 4. Running the Application

Launch the server from the project's root directory:
```bash
uvicorn src.app.app:app --reload
```
The application is now accessible:
-   **Web Interface**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
-   **API Documentation**: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

### 5. Running Tests

This project uses `pytest` for unit testing. To run the tests, execute the following command from the root directory:
```bash
pytest
```

## 📱 How to Use

### Step 1: Build Your Knowledge Base
1.  **Add PDF Documents**: Drag and drop your PDF files into the sidebar.
2.  **Select Context**: Click on the uploaded documents to select them as the context for answering questions. You can select multiple documents.
3.  **Manage Documents**: Delete documents you no longer need.

### Step 2: Submit Your MCQ
You have three options:

-   **Upload an Image**: Drag and drop a screenshot file of your MCQ.
-   **Built-in Screen Capture**: Click the "Capture Screen" button, select the area with the MCQ, and confirm.
-   **Paste from Clipboard**: Copy an image to your clipboard and paste it directly.

### Step 3: Get the Answer
The AI will process the image, find relevant information in your selected documents, and display the most likely answer along with the context it used.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

-   **API Key Errors**: Ensure your `GEMINI_API_KEY` is correctly set in the `.env` file.
-   **Screen Capture Issues**: Screen capture requires a secure context (localhost or HTTPS) and user permission. If the button is disabled, your browser may not be supported.
-   **Poor Answer Quality**: The quality of the answer depends heavily on the relevance of the information in your PDF documents. Ensure your knowledge base covers the topics of your questions.
